🍭Note to remember🍭 
"to enjoy the full access of Sweet Tooth Website"

A. You can start here at the ST_Homepage.html by clicking it ~ 
    - So there will be some buttons or clickables that are not functionable like:
    ❌ Header (Except Logo, and Recipes)
    ❌ Get Started
    ❌ Sweetie Tooth
    ❌ Sign Up (Except at Homepage, you can access the User page their or go to LogUser Folder and open ST_LASn_1.html to check it manually)
    ❌Footer

B. If you want to check other html pages - check LogUser and RecipeContent
    ✅ On Recipe Content you can see all the 11 recipes (PS: Di ko pa rin na-include yung naka-assign sa akin, pero will do it soon)
    ✅ On LogUser you can see other html for LogIn, Collection, and User Collection. 

C. If you notice some errors or problem along the way feel free to contact us hahaha

D. And Finally I hope you enjoy your navigation in our websitee 💕💗
